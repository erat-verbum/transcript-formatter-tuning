She stands at the door to the kings inner court. She has not been invited into his presence. She hesitates, knowing the fateful step to follow. She may wear the royal robes as a Persian queen, yet she is far more a prized possession than a beloved wife. In fact, the very circumstances of her ascent to the palace were designed to put queens, and all women in the empire, in their place. Her predecessor had refused the kings summons when he desired to show off her beauty at a royal feast. In response, the king deposed his queen and launched an empire-wide search for a new one. Esther, an orphaned Jew under the care of her uncle Mordecai, had won the pageant. She may be a queen, but she is far from his peer -- and not even his only woman. Esther now stands at a crossroads between one likely death or another. The king has been tricked into issuing an irreversible edict against the Jews, not knowing his new queen is Jewish. Her uncle has pled she help her people and warns she too may die if the decree endures. At the same time, death may await if she approaches the king unbidden. Known by all, the royal dictate stipulates, If any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law -- to be put to death. That is, with one exception. Uninvited visitors will be assumed dead on arrival except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live Esther 4 11. Even though Esther questions whether she might not presently be in his good favor As for me, I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days, verse 11, she embraces the risk and puts her hand to the door, knowing, as she has said to her uncle, If I perish, I perish verse 17. She enters. Today, some 2,500 years later, we still celebrate Esthers courage. Faced with such uncertainties and possible death on two sides, she took action that might rescue others, rather than waiting passively for her own fate. But mark this those who claim Christ do not stand in Esthers uninvited, uncertain place when we dare to approach the inner court of heaven. Even though our Kings majesty far outstrips the Persian king of kings over 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia, we approach his throne to make our requests with a stunning confidence. Esther was not wrong to proceed with caution, yet we draw near to a far higher throne and do so with boldness, knowing that, in Christ, the God of heaven already has extended to us his golden scepter. Christian prayer invites a striking mingling of the utmost reverence with the deepest confidence. First, reverence -- and nothing less than reverence -- befits our drawing near to the very throne of heaven, the seat of God Almighty, the all-seeing, all-just, and all-powerful. We need the rebalancing of the Holy Spirit, the whole Christ, and wholesome fellowship. As for that Persian ruler, so-called king of kings, so great were the riches of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his greatness that he could make a show of them for 180 days Esther 1 4. Known to history as Xerxes the Great, his majesty far outshone that of David and Solomon, and even Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus. He was the wealthiest and most powerful man alive, more so than any who had lived to that point in time, surpassing not only his peers but his predecessors. Ponder such a king, and then compare his glory to that of God Almighty. The Majesty who is the great King above all gods Psalm 95 3 is orders of magnitude greater than any Persian ruler. God Almighty deserves far greater reverence upon drawing near. One might dare approach Xerxes, as Esther did, and hope to land his favor. Should we not suspect, then, fear and uncertainty in approaching heavens throne that would dwarf that? Yet in Christ, the true king of kings -- and great high priest -- we are summoned to approach the throne with confidence. While Esther advanced toward the sovereign of Persia with feminine courage, all who are in Christ, men and women, Jew and Gentile, draw near to God Almighty, as exhorts Hebrews, with confidence. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Hebrews 4 16 In Jesus, we come not just to the Seat of Heaven, with its unsurpassed height and greatness, but we come to the throne of grace. It is indeed a throne. The Sovereign over all the world and its history sits in omnipotence. His Majesty far outshines the glories of ancient Persia and Greece and Rome and all human glories, past and present, combined. And still, Hebrews bids us come into his presence. How then might we, weak and inadequate as we are, muster sufficient reverence to approach such a dignitary? We are not left to ourselves, but we have a Helper who is God himself. According to Thomas Boston 1676 to 1732, Gods own Holy Spirit works in us a holy reverence of God, to whom we pray, which is necessary in acceptable prayer. By this view he strikes us with a holy dread and awe of the majesty of God Complete Works, 11 62. And we come to a throne of grace. Can we justly doubt the Fathers favor toward his own Son? The boldness with which we come is not confidence in ourselves, our merit, our dessert, our worth. It is confidence in Jesus, his person, his sonship, his acceptance, his priesthood, his merit, his worth. And here too, we have a Helper. Gods own Spirit, says Boston, works in us this holy confidence This is it that makes prayer an ease to a troubled heart, the Spirit exciting in us holy confidence in God as a Father. If you ask, How will I get this mingling right? Is it not beyond me to have both a reverence worthy of God and a confidence worthy of Christ? Yes, it is beyond us. Which is why the Helper, dwelling in us, is so vital in prayer. He helps us in our weakness Romans 8 26. He works in us reverence, works in us boldness, and keeps working in us their mingling. And with such help, Joseph Hall 1574 to 1656 is so bold as to say, Good prayers never come weeping home. I am sure I shall receive either what I ask or what I should ask. As we pray, day in and day out, we lean on the Spirit to feed both holy reverence and holy confidence in our hearts. And with his help, we seek to keep the whole story of the whole Christ before us his self-emptying in becoming human, his self-humbling in going to the cross, and his power and glory in rising from the dead and ascending to heaven and being seated at Gods right hand. For whole prayers, we need the whole Christ creator God and fellow man. And we need his whole story condescension in the incarnation and cross, and exaltation up from the grave and up to heaven and up to the throne. We need his majesty and meekness, which make us both reverent Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name . . . and confident . . . in Jesuss name we pray. Doubtless, our human lives and church lives are complex. In our finitude and sin, we often emphasize one truth to the detriment of another. In both our prayer closets and corporate petitions, we tip toward imbalances -- too casual or too timid -- and need the rebalancing of the Holy Spirit, the whole Christ, and wholesome fellowship. And so along this journey, God manages this mingling in us, this holy blend of awe before his Majesty and audacity in our Messiah. So, what became of Esthers daring entrance? When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she won favor in his sight, and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter. And the king said to her, What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom. Esther 5 2 to 3 So too we come and keep coming -- daily in prayer, weekly in corporate worship. Gods Spirit gives us reverence with confidence, humility with boldness, awe with audacity. In light of Gods might, we approach him with holy fear in light of his mercy, we come with expectant delight. In Christ, we enter not only assured that we already have the Kings favor but knowing that our Fathers kingdom far surpasses all others. And it is our Fathers good pleasure to give it all, with Christ, to his church. Knowing our lowliness and Christs worthiness, we neither grovel nor saunter into the presence of God. And we do not go home flippant or weeping. In Christ, we will receive what we ask or what we should have asked. Thank you, Holy Spirit.\\n\\n<end of article>', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '# Awe with Audacity\\n\\n> He helps the soul to approach with confidence, and yet with reverence; with filial fear, and yet with an emboldened faith; with zeal and importunity, and yet with humble submission; with lively hope, and yet with self-denial.\\n> \\n> --David Clarkson (1622-1686)\\n\\nImagine Esther.

Uninvited visitors will be assumed dead on arrival \"except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live\" ([Esther 4:11](https://ref.ly/Esther%204.11;esv?t=biblia)).\\n\\nEven though Esther questions whether she might not presently be in his good favor (\"As for me, I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days,\" verse 11), she embraces the risk and puts her hand to the door, knowing, as she has said to her uncle, \"If I perish, I perish\" (verse 17).\\n\\nShe enters.\\n\\n## God\\'s Golden Scepter\\n\\nToday, some 2,500 years later, we still celebrate Esther\\'s courage. Faced with such uncertainties and possible death on two sides, she took action that might rescue others, rather than waiting passively for her own fate.\\n\\nBut mark this: those who claim Christ do not stand in Esther\\'s uninvited, uncertain place when we dare to approach the inner court of heaven. Even though our King\\'s majesty far outstrips the Persian \"king of kings\" over 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia, we approach his throne to make our requests _with a stunning confidence_.\\n\\nEsther was not wrong to proceed with caution, yet we draw near to a far higher throne and do so with boldness, knowing that, in Christ, the God of heaven already has extended to us his golden scepter.\\n\\n## Come with Awe\\n\\nChristian prayer invites a striking mingling of the utmost reverence with the deepest confidence.\\n\\nFirst, reverence -- and nothing less than reverence -- befits our drawing near to the very throne of heaven, the seat of God Almighty, the all-seeing, all-just, and all-powerful.\\n\\n> \"We need the rebalancing of the Holy Spirit, the whole Christ, and wholesome fellowship.\"\\n\\nAs for that Persian ruler, so-called \"king of kings,\" so great were \"the riches of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his greatness\" that he could make a show of them for 180 days ([Esther 1:4](https://ref.ly/Esther%201.4;esv?t=biblia)). Known to history as Xerxes the Great, his majesty far outshone that of David and Solomon, and even Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus. He was the wealthiest and most powerful man alive, more so than any who had lived to that point in time, surpassing not only his peers but his predecessors.\\n\\nPonder such a king, and then compare his glory to that of God Almighty. The Majesty who is the \"great King above all gods\" ([Psalm 95:3](https://ref.ly/Ps%2095.3;esv?t=biblia)) is orders of magnitude greater than any Persian ruler. God Almighty deserves far greater reverence upon drawing near. One might dare approach Xerxes, as Esther did, and hope to land his favor. Should we not suspect, then, fear and uncertainty in approaching heaven\\'s throne that would dwarf that?\\n\\n## Come with Audacity\\n\\nYet in Christ, the true king of kings -- and great high priest -- we are summoned to approach the throne _with confidence_. While Esther advanced toward the sovereign of Persia with feminine courage, all who are in Christ, men and women, Jew and Gentile, draw near to God Almighty, as exhorts Hebrews, _with confidence_.\\n\\n> Let us then _with confidence_ draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. ([Hebrews 4:16](https://ref.ly/Heb%204.16;esv?t=biblia))\\n\\nIn Jesus, we come not just to the Seat of Heaven, with its unsurpassed height and greatness, but we come to \"the throne of grace.\" It is indeed a _throne_. The Sovereign over all the world and its history sits in omnipotence. His Majesty far outshines the glories of ancient Persia and Greece and Rome and all human glories, past and present, combined. And still, Hebrews bids us come into his presence.\\n\\nHow then might we, weak and inadequate as we are, muster sufficient reverence to approach such a dignitary? We are not left to ourselves, but we have a Helper who is God himself. According to Thomas Boston (1676-1732), God\\'s own Holy Spirit works in us \"a holy reverence of God, to whom we pray, which is necessary in acceptable prayer. By this view he strikes us with a holy dread and awe of the majesty of God\" (Complete Works, 11:62.)\\n\\nAnd we come to a throne of _grace_. Can we justly doubt the Father\\'s favor toward his own Son? The boldness with which we come is not confidence in ourselves, our merit, our dessert, our worth. It is confidence in Jesus, his person, his sonship, his acceptance, his priesthood, his merit, his worth. And here too, we have a Helper. God\\'s own Spirit, says Boston, works in us this holy confidence: \"This is it that makes prayer an ease to a troubled heart, the Spirit exciting in us holy confidence in God as a Father.\"\\n\\n## Come in the Spirit\\n\\nIf you ask, \"How will I get this mingling right? Is it not beyond me to have both a reverence worthy of God and a confidence worthy of Christ?\" Yes, it is beyond us. Which is why the Helper, dwelling in us, is so vital in prayer. He helps us in our weakness ([Romans 8:26](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.26;esv?t=biblia)). He works in us reverence, works in us boldness, and keeps working in us their mingling. And with such help, Joseph Hall (1574-1656) is so bold as to say,\\n\\n> Good prayers never come weeping home. I am sure I shall receive either what I ask or what I should ask.\\n\\nAs we pray, day in and day out, we lean on the Spirit to feed both holy reverence and holy confidence in our hearts. And with his help, we seek to keep the whole story of the whole Christ before us: his self-emptying in becoming human, his self-humbling in going to the cross, and his power and glory in rising from the dead and ascending to heaven and being seated at God\\'s right hand.\\n\\nFor whole prayers, we need the whole Christ: creator God and fellow man. And we need his whole story: condescension in the incarnation and cross, and exaltation up from the grave and up to heaven and up to the throne. We need his majesty and meekness, which make us both _reverent_ (\"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name . . .\") and _confident_ (\". . . in Jesus\\'s name we pray\").\\n\\nDoubtless, our human lives and church lives are complex. In our finitude and sin, we often emphasize one truth to the detriment of another. In both our prayer closets and corporate petitions, we tip toward imbalances -- too casual or too timid -- and need the rebalancing of the Holy Spirit, the whole Christ, and wholesome fellowship. And so along this journey, God manages this mingling in us, this holy blend of awe before his Majesty and audacity in our Messiah.\\n\\n## What You Ask or Better\\n\\nSo, what became of Esther\\'s daring entrance?\\n\\n> When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she won favor in his sight, and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter. And the king said to her, \"What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom.\" ([Esther 5:2-3](https://ref.ly/Esther%205.2%E2%80%933;esv?t=biblia))\\n\\nSo too we come and keep coming -- daily in prayer, weekly in corporate worship. God\\'s Spirit gives us reverence with confidence, humility with boldness, awe with audacity. In light of God\\'s might, we approach him with holy fear; in light of his mercy, we come with expectant delight.\\n\\nIn Christ, we enter not only assured that we already have the King\\'s favor but knowing that our Father\\'s kingdom far surpasses all others. And it is our Father\\'s good pleasure to give it all, with Christ, to his church.\\n\\nKnowing our lowliness and Christ\\'s worthiness, we neither grovel nor saunter into the presence of God. And we do not go home flippant or weeping. In Christ, we will receive what we ask or what we should have asked. Thank you, Holy Spirit.\\n\\n', 'role': 'assistant'}]}\n"

Robert Clinton conducted a now-famous study of how leaders in Scripture finished their tenures. Of those about whom he was able to get sufficient data, Clinton determined that about one in three finished well. Commenting on the contemporary scene, he suggested that the ratio is probably even worse. But if what the Bible says about Gods keeping power is true Philippians 1 6https ref.lyPhil201.6esv?tbiblia 2 Timothy 1 12, it does not have to be so. I want to focus on two issues that hinder people from finishing well. The first is disappointment over what they have experienced. When talking to Christian leaders, I have often found that, once you get below the surface, there is deep-seated anger or discontentment over disappointing experiences they have had. The second issue is insecurity -- a feeling of inadequacy that triggers harmful attitudes, actions, and lifestyles. Both of these are heavy loads to carry, and they easily trigger negative feelings about ministry that could overwhelm us and destroy the joy of service. One key to health in ministry is learning to lament. Romans 8 20 to 39https ref.lyRom208.20E2809339esv?tbiblia gives some important direction for experiencing deep fulfillment while facing disappointment. Paul says that the creation -- including believers who have the firstfruits of the Spirit -- has been subjected to futility or frustration Romans 8 20https ref.lyRom208.20esv?tbiblia, 23. In other words, frustration is an inevitable reality in the life of service. Things will go wrong. People will hurt us. Our faithful service will be rejected. We will experience physical or mental infirmities that drag us down. And we will even appear to be failures on earth despite a life of costly obedience. If we dont come to grips with the fact that frustration is part and parcel of our present experience, disappointment can overwhelm us. Paul himself experienced this frustration throughout his time in ministry. As he languished in prison, many labeled him a failure and even sought to bring him lower Philippians 1 15 to 18https ref.lyPhil201.15E2809318esv?tbiblia. Many were ashamed of him and refused to stand by him 2 Timothy 4 16https ref.ly220Tim204.16esv?tbiblia. But writing from prison, he said, I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content Philippians 4 11. Contentment -- especially in the midst of frustration -- is a virtue to learn. And what exactly did Paul learn? Well, among other lessons, he learned to lament or groan with the rest of creation Romans 8 22 to 23. Though this groaning anticipates coming glory, the cry of pain is so severe that it is compared to the pains of childbirth. The lament is the most repeated example of this Spirit-led groaning in the Bible. Over a third of the Psalms are classified as laments, and many of them use raw language to describe the pain the psalmist experienced. The Bible gives us permission to express our pain in the face of frustration. We can lament directly to God and to believers whom we trust. In doing so, we arrest the process whereby pain deteriorates into bitterness. And by honestly expressing our pain, we also open ourselves to Gods comfort. If you want to weather the inevitable disappointments of ministry, learn how to express your pain in groaning. A second key to thriving in ministry is a high vision of the sovereignty of God. Paul describes stunning reality in Romans 8 28https ref.lyRom208.28esv?tbiblia when he says, For those who love God all things work together for good. Good will come even out of our most painful experiences. As evidence of Gods commitment to our welfare, Paul says that God did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all Romans 8 32, so he will undoubtedly provide everything else we need. People basking in Gods love are happy people. If we really grasp such commitment to us by the Lord of the universe, our insecurity will be erased. In fact, we have the assurance that in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us Romans 8 37https ref.lyRom208.37esv?tbiblia. The fear of failure is banished when we reckon that if God is for us, who can be against us? Romans 8 31https ref.lyRom208.31esv?tbiblia. As we exercise faith in Gods sovereignty, we abound in hope, which fills us with joy and peace Romans 15 13. Many attribute burnout to overwork. But I suspect more often insecurity, resulting in unhealthy work habits, causes burnout. When we are unsure of our worth and our position, we can drive ourselves into the ground. The mad rush to prove ourselves successful according to worldly criteria leaves us unhappy and without the peace of God. This craving for affirmation can have disastrous results -- like the inability to trust others or the attempt to find refuge in extramarital affairs. Insecure people are easy prey for the enemy and thus prime candidates for not ending well. How can we let Gods sovereignty banish burnout-causing insecurity? At the risk of sounding simplistic, spend slow, meditative time with God daily in prayer and Scripture. That habit almost unconsciously challenges our insecurity. For example, when you read Deuteronomy 33 27https ref.lyDeut2033.27esv?tbiblia -- The eternal God is your dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms -- you find a solid foundation for security. Our identity in him takes away the shame that society, with its competitive ethos, inflicts upon us. For those who look to him daily are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed Psalm 34 5. I dont mean to imply daily time with God is always exciting and emotionally inspiring. Its not, but I am daily building the firm foundation upon which I stand. That has a way of buttressing my security. The same goes for prayer. Though it can feel laborious, I know that I have been with the eternal God, who is also my Father. Lingering in the presence of God enables the truths about God that we know in our heads to travel to the heart. A third key to remaining joyful in service is experiencing Gods love for us. At the end of Romans 8, after two imposing lists of obstacles we face in life, Paul affirms that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ Romans 8 35https ref.lyRom208.35esv?tbiblia, 38 to 39https ref.lyRomans208.38E2809339esv?tbiblia. This unstoppable love reframes our frustration. Gods love overflows into our lives and attacks the bitterness that threatens our contentment Romans 5 5. People basking in Gods love are happy people 1 John 3 1https ref.ly120John203.1esv?tbiblia. How could it be otherwise? Experiencing Gods love results in joy and provides the key to serving God over the long haul. Jesus told his disciples, These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full John 15 11https ref.lyJohn2015.11esv?tbiblia. After that, he gave a call to sacrificial service This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you John 15 12. First the joy then the ministry. I once heard David Sitton, founder of To Every Tribe Mission, tell a story from his teenage years when a ninety-year-old missionary spoke at the youth fellowship of his church. The man had been a missionary for 72 years. At the start of his talk, he kept repeating something like, I want you to remember this. You can forget everything else I say, but dont forget this. As he kept saying this, the young people were getting impatient, wishing that he would go ahead and give them this gem of wisdom. Finally, he said, The joy of the Lord is your strength. When the joy goes, the strength goes. Having said that, he sat down! This experience of the Fathers love and joy bookmarked Jesuss own ministry. He began by basking in the Fathers love and delight embodied in the Spirit Matthew 3 16 to 17https ref.lyMatt203.16E2809317esv?tbiblia. And that joy proved sufficient to sustain him through the greatest groaning and hardest act of service imaginable. For the joy that was set before him he endured the cross Hebrews 12 2. All of our joyful, lasting ministry looks to him Hebrews 12 1. Coming to grips with the reality of frustration and knowing how to express our pain prevents disillusionment. The realities of Gods sovereignty and love open the door to experiencing joy. So, pursue the joy of the Lord day after day. It alone will sustain us in ministry over the long haul.\\n\\n<end of article>',\n",

Dr. J. Robert Clinton conducted a now-famous study of how leaders in Scripture finished their tenures. Of those about whom he was able to get sufficient data, Clinton determined that about one in three finished well. Commenting on the contemporary scene, he suggested that the ratio is probably even worse. But if what the Bible says about Gods keeping power is true Philippians 1 6https ref.lyPhil201.6esv?tbiblia 2 Timothy 1 12, it does not have to be so. I want to focus on two issues that hinder people from finishing well. The first is disappointment over what they have experienced. When talking to Christian leaders, I have often found that, once you get below the surface, there is deep-seated anger or discontentment over disappointing experiences they have had. The second issue is insecurity -- a feeling of inadequacy that triggers harmful attitudes, actions, and lifestyles. Both of these are heavy loads to carry, and they easily trigger negative feelings about ministry that could overwhelm us and destroy the joy of service. One key to health in ministry is learning to lament. Romans 8 20 to 39https ref.lyRom208.20E2809339esv?tbiblia gives some important direction for experiencing deep fulfillment while facing disappointment. Paul says that the creation -- including believers who have the firstfruits of the Spirit -- has been subjected to futility or frustration Romans 8 20https ref.lyRom208.20esv?tbiblia, 23. In other words, frustration is an inevitable reality in the life of service. Things will go wrong. People will hurt us. Our faithful service will be rejected. We will experience physical or mental infirmities that drag us down. And we will even appear to be failures on earth despite a life of costly obedience. If we dont come to grips with the fact that frustration is part and parcel of our present experience, disappointment can overwhelm us. Paul himself experienced this frustration throughout his time in ministry. As he languished in prison, many labeled him a failure and even sought to bring him lower Philippians 1 15 to 18https ref.lyPhil201.15E2809318esv?tbiblia. Many were ashamed of him and refused to stand by him 2 Timothy 4 16https ref.ly220Tim204.16esv?tbiblia. But writing from prison, he said, I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content Philippians 4 11. Contentment -- especially in the midst of frustration -- is a virtue to learn. And what exactly did Paul learn? Well, among other lessons, he learned to lament or groan with the rest of creation Romans 8 22 to 23. Though this groaning anticipates coming glory, the cry of pain is so severe that it is compared to the pains of childbirth. The lament is the most repeated example of this Spirit-led groaning in the Bible. Over a third of the Psalms are classified as laments, and many of them use raw language to describe the pain the psalmist experienced. The Bible gives us permission to express our pain in the face of frustration. We can lament directly to God and to believers whom we trust. In doing so, we arrest the process whereby pain deteriorates into bitterness. And by honestly expressing our pain, we also open ourselves to Gods comfort. If you want to weather the inevitable disappointments of ministry, learn how to express your pain in groaning. A second key to thriving in ministry is a high vision of the sovereignty of God. Paul describes stunning reality in Romans 8 28https ref.lyRom208.28esv?tbiblia when he says, For those who love God all things work together for good. Good will come even out of our most painful experiences. As evidence of Gods commitment to our welfare, Paul says that God did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all Romans 8 32, so he will undoubtedly provide everything else we need. People basking in Gods love are happy people. If we really grasp such commitment to us by the Lord of the universe, our insecurity will be erased. In fact, we have the assurance that in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us Romans 8 37https ref.lyRom208.37esv?tbiblia. The fear of failure is banished when we reckon that if God is for us, who can be against us? Romans 8 31https ref.lyRom208.31esv?tbiblia. As we exercise faith in Gods sovereignty, we abound in hope, which fills us with joy and peace Romans 15 13. Many attribute burnout to overwork. But I suspect more often insecurity, resulting in unhealthy work habits, causes burnout. When we are unsure of our worth and our position, we can drive ourselves into the ground. The mad rush to prove ourselves successful according to worldly criteria leaves us unhappy and without the peace of God. This craving for affirmation can have disastrous results -- like the inability to trust others or the attempt to find refuge in extramarital affairs. Insecure people are easy prey for the enemy and thus prime candidates for not ending well. How can we let Gods sovereignty banish burnout-causing insecurity? At the risk of sounding simplistic, spend slow, meditative time with God daily in prayer and Scripture. That habit almost unconsciously challenges our insecurity. For example, when you read Deuteronomy 33 27https ref.lyDeut2033.27esv?tbiblia -- The eternal God is your dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms -- you find a solid foundation for security. Our identity in him takes away the shame that society, with its competitive ethos, inflicts upon us. For those who look to him daily are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed Psalm 34 5. I dont mean to imply daily time with God is always exciting and emotionally inspiring. Its not, but I am daily building the firm foundation upon which I stand. That has a way of buttressing my security. The same goes for prayer. Though it can feel laborious, I know that I have been with the eternal God, who is also my Father. Lingering in the presence of God enables the truths about God that we know in our heads to travel to the heart. A third key to remaining joyful in service is experiencing Gods love for us. At the end of Romans 8, after two imposing lists of obstacles we face in life, Paul affirms that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ Romans 8 35https ref.lyRom208.35esv?tbiblia, 38 to 39https ref.lyRomans208.38E2809339esv?tbiblia. This unstoppable love reframes our frustration. Gods love overflows into our lives and attacks the bitterness that threatens our contentment Romans 5 5. People basking in Gods love are happy people 1 John 3 1https ref.ly120John203.1esv?tbiblia. How could it be otherwise? Experiencing Gods love results in joy and provides the key to serving God over the long haul. Jesus told his disciples, These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full John 15 11https ref.lyJohn2015.11esv?tbiblia. After that, he gave a call to sacrificial service This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you John 15 12. First the joy then the ministry. I once heard David Sitton, founder of To Every Tribe Mission, tell a story from his teenage years when a ninety-year-old missionary spoke at the youth fellowship of his church. The man had been a missionary for 72 years. At the start of his talk, he kept repeating something like, I want you to remember this. You can forget everything else I say, but dont forget this. As he kept saying this, the young people were getting impatient, wishing that he would go ahead and give them this gem of wisdom. Finally, he said, The joy of the Lord is your strength. When the joy goes, the strength goes. Having said that, he sat down! This experience of the Fathers love and joy bookmarked Jesuss own ministry. He began by basking in the Fathers love and delight embodied in the Spirit Matthew 3 16 to 17https ref.lyMatt203.16E2809317esv?tbiblia. And that joy proved sufficient to sustain him through the greatest groaning and hardest act of service imaginable. For the joy that was set before him he endured the cross Hebrews 12 2. All of our joyful, lasting ministry looks to him Hebrews 12 1. Coming to grips with the reality of frustration and knowing how to express our pain prevents disillusionment. The realities of Gods sovereignty and love open the door to experiencing joy. So, pursue the joy of the Lord day after day.

Paul says that the creation -- including believers \"who have the firstfruits of the Spirit\" -- has been \"subjected to futility \\\\[or _frustration_\\\\]\" ([Romans 8:20](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.20;esv?t=biblia), [23](https://ref.ly/Romans%208.23;esv?t=biblia)). In other words, frustration is an inevitable reality in the life of service. Things will go wrong. People will hurt us. Our faithful service will be rejected. We will experience physical or mental infirmities that drag us down. And we will even appear to be failures on earth despite a life of costly obedience. If we don\\'t come to grips with the fact that frustration is part and parcel of our present experience, disappointment can overwhelm us.\\n\\nPaul himself experienced this frustration throughout his time in ministry. As he languished in prison, many labeled him a failure and even sought to bring him lower ([Philippians 1:15-18](https://ref.ly/Phil%201.15%E2%80%9318;esv?t=biblia)). Many were ashamed of him and refused to stand by him ([2 Timothy 4:16](https://ref.ly/2%20Tim%204.16;esv?t=biblia)). But writing from prison, he said, \"I have _learned_ in whatever situation I am to be content\" ([Philippians 4:11](https://ref.ly/Phil%204.11;esv?t=biblia)). Contentment -- especially in the midst of frustration -- is a virtue to learn.\\n\\nAnd what exactly did Paul learn? Well, among other lessons, he learned to lament or _groan_ with the rest of creation ([Romans 8:22-23](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.22%E2%80%9323;esv?t=biblia)). Though this groaning anticipates coming glory, the cry of pain is so severe that it is compared to the pains of childbirth. The lament is the most repeated example of this Spirit-led groaning in the Bible. Over a third of the Psalms are classified as laments, and many of them use raw language to describe the pain the psalmist experienced.\\n\\nThe Bible gives us permission to express our pain in the face of frustration. We can lament directly to God and to believers whom we trust. In doing so, we arrest the process whereby pain deteriorates into bitterness. And by honestly expressing our pain, we also open ourselves to God\\'s comfort. If you want to weather the inevitable disappointments of ministry, learn how to express your pain in groaning.\\n\\n## 2\\\\. Let sovereignty unseat insecurity.\\n\\nA second key to thriving in ministry is _a high vision of the sovereignty of God_. Paul describes stunning reality in [Romans 8:28](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.28;esv?t=biblia) when he says, \"For those who love God all things work together for good.\" Good will come even out of our most painful experiences. As evidence of God\\'s commitment to our welfare, Paul says that God \"did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all\" ([Romans 8:32](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.32;esv?t=biblia)), so he will undoubtedly provide everything else we need.\\n\\n> \"People basking in God\\'s love are happy people.\"\\n\\nIf we really grasp such commitment to us by the Lord of the universe, our _insecurity_ will be erased. In fact, we have the assurance that \"in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us\" ([Romans 8:37](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.37;esv?t=biblia)). The fear of failure is banished when we reckon that \"if God is for us, who can be against us?\" ([Romans 8:31](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.31;esv?t=biblia)). As we exercise faith in God\\'s sovereignty, we \"abound in hope,\" which fills us with \"joy and peace\" ([Romans 15:13](https://ref.ly/Rom%2015.13;esv?t=biblia)).\\n\\nMany attribute burnout to overwork. But I suspect more often insecurity, resulting in unhealthy work habits, causes burnout. When we are unsure of our worth and our position, we can drive ourselves into the ground. The mad rush to prove ourselves successful according to worldly criteria leaves us unhappy and without the peace of God. This craving for affirmation can have disastrous results -- like the inability to trust others or the attempt to find refuge in extramarital affairs. Insecure people are easy prey for the enemy and thus prime candidates for not ending well.\\n\\nHow can we let God\\'s sovereignty banish burnout-causing insecurity? At the risk of sounding simplistic, spend slow, meditative time with God daily in prayer and Scripture. That habit almost unconsciously challenges our insecurity. For example, when you read [Deuteronomy 33:27](https://ref.ly/Deut%2033.27;esv?t=biblia) -- \"The eternal God is your dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms\" -- you find a solid foundation for security. Our identity in him takes away the shame that society, with its competitive ethos, inflicts upon us. For \"those who look to him \\\\[daily\\\\] are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed\" ([Psalm 34:5](https://ref.ly/Ps%2034.5;esv?t=biblia)).\\n\\nI don\\'t mean to imply daily time with God is always exciting and emotionally inspiring. It\\'s not, but I am daily building the firm foundation upon which I stand. That has a way of buttressing my security. The same goes for prayer. Though it can feel laborious, I know that I have been with the eternal God, who is also my Father. Lingering in the presence of God enables the truths about God that we know in our heads to travel to the heart.\\n\\n## 3\\\\. Enjoy God\\'s covenant love.\\n\\nA third key to remaining joyful in service is _experiencing God\\'s love for us_. At the end of Romans 8, after two imposing lists of obstacles we face in life, Paul affirms that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ ([Romans 8:35](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.35;esv?t=biblia), [38-39](https://ref.ly/Romans%208.38%E2%80%9339;esv?t=biblia)). This unstoppable love reframes our frustration. God\\'s love overflows into our lives and attacks the bitterness that threatens our contentment ([Romans 5:5](https://ref.ly/Rom%205.5;esv?t=biblia)).\\n\\nPeople basking in God\\'s love are happy people ([1 John 3:1](https://ref.ly/1%20John%203.1;esv?t=biblia)). How could it be otherwise? Experiencing God\\'s love results in joy and provides the key to serving God over the long haul. Jesus told his disciples, \"These things I have spoken to you, that _my joy_ may be in you, and that _your joy_ may be full\" ([John 15:11](https://ref.ly/John%2015.11;esv?t=biblia)). After that, he gave a call to sacrificial service: \"This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you\" ([John 15:12](https://ref.ly/John%2015.12;esv?t=biblia)). First the joy; then the ministry.\\n\\nI once heard David Sitton, founder of To Every Tribe Mission, tell a story from his teenage years when a ninety-year-old missionary spoke at the youth fellowship of his church. The man had been a missionary for 72 years. At the start of his talk, he kept repeating something like, \"I want you to remember this. You can forget everything else I say, but don\\'t forget this.\" As he kept saying this, the young people were getting impatient, wishing that he would go ahead and give them this gem of wisdom. Finally, he said, \"The joy of the Lord is your strength. When the joy goes, the strength goes.\" Having said that, he sat down!\\n\\nThis experience of the Father\\'s love and joy bookmarked Jesus\\'s own ministry. He began by basking in the Father\\'s love and delight embodied in the Spirit ([Matthew 3:16-17](https://ref.ly/Matt%203.16%E2%80%9317;esv?t=biblia)). And that joy proved sufficient to sustain him through the greatest groaning and hardest act of service imaginable. \"For the joy that was set before him \\\\[he\\\\] endured the cross\" ([Hebrews 12:2](https://ref.ly/Heb%2012.2;esv?t=biblia)).\\n\\nAll of our joyful, lasting ministry looks to him ([Hebrews 12:1](https://ref.ly/Heb%2012.1;esv?t=biblia)). Coming to grips with the reality of frustration and knowing how to express our pain prevents disillusionment. The realities of God\\'s sovereignty and love open the door to experiencing joy. So, pursue the joy of the Lord day after day. It alone will sustain us in ministry over the long haul.\\n\\n',\n",

Dr. J. Robert Clinton conducted a now-famous study of how leaders in Scripture finished their tenures. Of those about whom he was able to get sufficient data, Clinton determined that about one in three finished well. Commenting on the contemporary scene, he suggested that the ratio is probably even worse. But if what the Bible says about Gods keeping power is true Philippians 1 6https ref.lyPhil201.6esv?tbiblia 2 Timothy 1 12, it does not have to be so. I want to focus on two issues that hinder people from finishing well. The first is disappointment over what they have experienced. When talking to Christian leaders, I have often found that, once you get below the surface, there is deep-seated anger or discontentment over disappointing experiences they have had. The second issue is insecurity -- a feeling of inadequacy that triggers harmful attitudes, actions, and lifestyles. Both of these are heavy loads to carry, and they easily trigger negative feelings about ministry that could overwhelm us and destroy the joy of service. One key to health in ministry is learning to lament. Romans 8 20 to 39https ref.lyRom208.20E2809339esv?tbiblia gives some important direction for experiencing deep fulfillment while facing disappointment.

In other words, frustration is an inevitable reality in the life of service. Things will go wrong. People will hurt us. Our faithful service will be rejected.

Dr. J. Robert Clinton conducted a now-famous study of how leaders in Scripture finished their tenures. Of those about whom he was able to get sufficient data, Clinton determined that about one in three finished well. Commenting on the contemporary scene, he suggested that the ratio is probably even worse. But if what the Bible says about Gods keeping power is true Philippians 1 6https ref.lyPhil201.6esv?tbiblia 2 Timothy 1 12, it does not have to be so. I want to focus on two issues that hinder people from finishing well. The first is disappointment over what they have experienced. When talking to Christian leaders, I have often found that, once you get below the surface, there is deep-seated anger or discontentment over disappointing experiences they have had. The second issue is insecurity -- a feeling of inadequacy that triggers harmful attitudes, actions, and lifestyles. Both of these are heavy loads to carry, and they easily trigger negative feelings about ministry that could overwhelm us and destroy the joy of service. One key to health in ministry is learning to lament. Romans 8 20 to 39https ref.lyRom208.20E2809339esv?tbiblia gives some important direction for experiencing deep fulfillment while facing disappointment. Paul says that the creation -- including believers who have the firstfruits of the Spirit -- has been subjected to futility or frustration Romans 8 20https ref.lyRom208.20esv?tbiblia, 23. In other words, frustration is an inevitable reality in the life of service. Things will go wrong. People will hurt us. Our faithful service will be rejected. We will experience physical or mental infirmities that drag us down. And we will even appear to be failures on earth despite a life of costly obedience. If we dont come to grips with the fact that frustration is part and parcel of our present experience, disappointment can overwhelm us. Paul himself experienced this frustration throughout his time in ministry. As he languished in prison, many labeled him a failure and even sought to bring him lower Philippians 1 15 to 18https ref.lyPhil201.15E2809318esv?tbiblia. Many were ashamed of him and refused to stand by him 2 Timothy 4 16https ref.ly220Tim204.16esv?tbiblia. But writing from prison, he said, I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content Philippians 4 11. Contentment -- especially in the midst of frustration -- is a virtue to learn. And what exactly did Paul learn? Well, among other lessons, he learned to lament or groan with the rest of creation Romans 8 22 to 23. Though this groaning anticipates coming glory, the cry of pain is so severe that it is compared to the pains of childbirth. The lament is the most repeated example of this Spirit-led groaning in the Bible. Over a third of the Psalms are classified as laments, and many of them use raw language to describe the pain the psalmist experienced. The Bible gives us permission to express our pain in the face of frustration. We can lament directly to God and to believers whom we trust. In doing so, we arrest the process whereby pain deteriorates into bitterness. And by honestly expressing our pain, we also open ourselves to Gods comfort. If you want to weather the inevitable disappointments of ministry, learn how to express your pain in groaning. A second key to thriving in ministry is a high vision of the sovereignty of God. Paul describes stunning reality in Romans 8 28https ref.lyRom208.28esv?tbiblia when he says, For those who love God all things work together for good. Good will come even out of our most painful experiences. As evidence of Gods commitment to our welfare, Paul says that God did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all Romans 8 32, so he will undoubtedly provide everything else we need. People basking in Gods love are happy people. If we really grasp such commitment to us by the Lord of the universe, our insecurity will be erased. In fact, we have the assurance that in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us Romans 8 37https ref.lyRom208.37esv?tbiblia. The fear of failure is banished when we reckon that if God is for us, who can be against us? Romans 8 31https ref.lyRom208.31esv?tbiblia. As we exercise faith in Gods sovereignty, we abound in hope, which fills us with joy and peace Romans 15 13. Many attribute burnout to overwork. But I suspect more often insecurity, resulting in unhealthy work habits, causes burnout. When we are unsure of our worth and our position, we can drive ourselves into the ground. The mad rush to prove ourselves successful according to worldly criteria leaves us unhappy and without the peace of God. This craving for affirmation can have disastrous results -- like the inability to trust others or the attempt to find refuge in extramarital affairs. Insecure people are easy prey for the enemy and thus prime candidates for not ending well. How can we let Gods sovereignty banish burnout-causing insecurity? At the risk of sounding simplistic, spend slow, meditative time with God daily in prayer and Scripture. That habit almost unconsciously challenges our insecurity. For example, when you read Deuteronomy 33 27https ref.lyDeut2033.27esv?tbiblia -- The eternal God is your dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms -- you find a solid foundation for security. Our identity in him takes away the shame that society, with its competitive ethos, inflicts upon us. For those who look to him daily are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed Psalm 34 5. I dont mean to imply daily time with God is always exciting and emotionally inspiring. Its not, but I am daily building the firm foundation upon which I stand. That has a way of buttressing my security. The same goes for prayer. Though it can feel laborious, I know that I have been with the eternal God, who is also my Father. Lingering in the presence of God enables the truths about God that we know in our heads to travel to the heart. A third key to remaining joyful in service is experiencing Gods love for us. At the end of Romans 8, after two imposing lists of obstacles we face in life, Paul affirms that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ Romans 8 35https ref.lyRom208.35esv?tbiblia, 38 to 39https ref.lyRomans208.38E2809339esv?tbiblia. This unstoppable love reframes our frustration. Gods love overflows into our lives and attacks the bitterness that threatens our contentment Romans 5 5. People basking in Gods love are happy people 1 John 3 1https ref.ly120John203.1esv?tbiblia. How could it be otherwise? Experiencing Gods love results in joy and provides the key to serving God over the long haul. Jesus told his disciples, These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full John 15 11https ref.lyJohn2015.11esv?tbiblia. After that, he gave a call to sacrificial service This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you John 15 12. First the joy then the ministry. I once heard David Sitton, founder of To Every Tribe Mission, tell a story from his teenage years when a ninety-year-old missionary spoke at the youth fellowship of his church. The man had been a missionary for 72 years. At the start of his talk, he kept repeating something like, I want you to remember this. You can forget everything else I say, but dont forget this. As he kept saying this, the young people were getting impatient, wishing that he would go ahead and give them this gem of wisdom. Finally, he said, The joy of the Lord is your strength. When the joy goes, the strength goes. Having said that, he sat down! This experience of the Fathers love and joy bookmarked Jesuss own ministry. He began by basking in the Fathers love and delight embodied in the Spirit Matthew 3 16 to 17https ref.lyMatt203.16E2809317esv?tbiblia. And that joy proved sufficient to sustain him through the greatest groaning and hardest act of service imaginable. For the joy that was set before him he endured the cross Hebrews 12 2. All of our joyful, lasting ministry looks to him Hebrews 12 1. Coming to grips with the reality of frustration and knowing how to express our pain prevents disillusionment. The realities of Gods sovereignty and love open the door to experiencing joy. So, pursue the joy of the Lord day after day. It alone will sustain us in ministry over the long haul.\\n\\n<end of article><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n# Joy Banishes Burnout\\n\\nStatistics of servants of God who do not end well can be very discouraging.

He began by basking in the Father\\'s love and delight embodied in the Spirit ([Matthew 3:16-17](https://ref.ly/Matt%203.16%E2%80%9317;esv?t=biblia)). And that joy proved sufficient to sustain him through the greatest groaning and hardest act of service imaginable. \"For the joy that was set before him \\\\[he\\\\] endured the cross\" ([Hebrews 12:2](https://ref.ly/Heb%2012.2;esv?t=biblia)).\\n\\nAll of our joyful, lasting ministry looks to him ([Hebrews 12:1](https://ref.ly/Heb%2012.1;esv?t=biblia)). Coming to grips with the reality of frustration and knowing how to express our pain prevents disillusionment. The realities of God\\'s sovereignty and love open the door to experiencing joy. So, pursue the joy of the Lord day after day. It alone will sustain us in ministry over the long haul.\\n\\n<|eot_id|>'"

Dr. J. Robert Clinton conducted a now-famous study of how leaders in Scripture finished their tenures. Of those about whom he was able to get sufficient data, Clinton determined that about one in three finished well. Commenting on the contemporary scene, he suggested that the ratio is probably even worse. But if what the Bible says about God\\'s keeping power is true ([Philippians 1:6](https://ref.ly/Phil%201.6;esv?t=biblia); [2 Timothy 1:12](https://ref.ly/2%20Tim%201.12;esv?t=biblia)), it does not have to be so.\\n\\nI want to focus on two issues that hinder people from finishing well. The first is _disappointment_ over what they have experienced. When talking to Christian leaders, I have often found that, once you get below the surface, there is deep-seated anger or discontentment over disappointing experiences they have had. The second issue is _insecurity_ -- a feeling of inadequacy that triggers harmful attitudes, actions, and lifestyles. Both of these are heavy loads to carry, and they easily trigger negative feelings about ministry that could overwhelm us and destroy the joy of service.\\n\\n## 1\\\\. Learn to lament.\\n\\nOne key to health in ministry is _learning to lament_. [Romans 8:20-39](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.20%E2%80%9339;esv?t=biblia) gives some important direction for experiencing deep fulfillment while facing disappointment. Paul says that the creation -- including believers \"who have the firstfruits of the Spirit\" -- has been \"subjected to futility \\\\[or _frustration_\\\\]\" ([Romans 8:20](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.20;esv?t=biblia), [23](https://ref.ly/Romans%208.23;esv?t=biblia)). In other words, frustration is an inevitable reality in the life of service. Things will go wrong. People will hurt us. Our faithful service will be rejected. We will experience physical or mental infirmities that drag us down. And we will even appear to be failures on earth despite a life of costly obedience. If we don\\'t come to grips with the fact that frustration is part and parcel of our present experience, disappointment can overwhelm us.\\n\\nPaul himself experienced this frustration throughout his time in ministry. As he languished in prison, many labeled him a failure and even sought to bring him lower ([Philippians 1:15-18](https://ref.ly/Phil%201.15%E2%80%9318;esv?t=biblia)). Many were ashamed of him and refused to stand by him ([2 Timothy 4:16](https://ref.ly/2%20Tim%204.16;esv?t=biblia)). But writing from prison, he said, \"I have _learned_ in whatever situation I am to be content\" ([Philippians 4:11](https://ref.ly/Phil%204.11;esv?t=biblia)). Contentment -- especially in the midst of frustration -- is a virtue to learn.\\n\\nAnd what exactly did Paul learn? Well, among other lessons, he learned to lament or _groan_ with the rest of creation ([Romans 8:22-23](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.22%E2%80%9323;esv?t=biblia)). Though this groaning anticipates coming glory, the cry of pain is so severe that it is compared to the pains of childbirth. The lament is the most repeated example of this Spirit-led groaning in the Bible. Over a third of the Psalms are classified as laments, and many of them use raw language to describe the pain the psalmist experienced.\\n\\nThe Bible gives us permission to express our pain in the face of frustration. We can lament directly to God and to believers whom we trust. In doing so, we arrest the process whereby pain deteriorates into bitterness. And by honestly expressing our pain, we also open ourselves to God\\'s comfort. If you want to weather the inevitable disappointments of ministry, learn how to express your pain in groaning.\\n\\n## 2\\\\. Let sovereignty unseat insecurity.\\n\\nA second key to thriving in ministry is _a high vision of the sovereignty of God_. Paul describes stunning reality in [Romans 8:28](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.28;esv?t=biblia) when he says, \"For those who love God all things work together for good.\" Good will come even out of our most painful experiences. As evidence of God\\'s commitment to our welfare, Paul says that God \"did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all\" ([Romans 8:32](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.32;esv?t=biblia)), so he will undoubtedly provide everything else we need.\\n\\n> \"People basking in God\\'s love are happy people.\"\\n\\nIf we really grasp such commitment to us by the Lord of the universe, our _insecurity_ will be erased. In fact, we have the assurance that \"in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us\" ([Romans 8:37](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.37;esv?t=biblia)). The fear of failure is banished when we reckon that \"if God is for us, who can be against us?\" ([Romans 8:31](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.31;esv?t=biblia)). As we exercise faith in God\\'s sovereignty, we \"abound in hope,\" which fills us with \"joy and peace\" ([Romans 15:13](https://ref.ly/Rom%2015.13;esv?t=biblia)).\\n\\nMany attribute burnout to overwork. But I suspect more often insecurity, resulting in unhealthy work habits, causes burnout. When we are unsure of our worth and our position, we can drive ourselves into the ground. The mad rush to prove ourselves successful according to worldly criteria leaves us unhappy and without the peace of God. This craving for affirmation can have disastrous results -- like the inability to trust others or the attempt to find refuge in extramarital affairs. Insecure people are easy prey for the enemy and thus prime candidates for not ending well.\\n\\nHow can we let God\\'s sovereignty banish burnout-causing insecurity? At the risk of sounding simplistic, spend slow, meditative time with God daily in prayer and Scripture. That habit almost unconsciously challenges our insecurity. For example, when you read [Deuteronomy 33:27](https://ref.ly/Deut%2033.27;esv?t=biblia) -- \"The eternal God is your dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms\" -- you find a solid foundation for security. Our identity in him takes away the shame that society, with its competitive ethos, inflicts upon us. For \"those who look to him \\\\[daily\\\\] are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed\" ([Psalm 34:5](https://ref.ly/Ps%2034.5;esv?t=biblia)).\\n\\nI don\\'t mean to imply daily time with God is always exciting and emotionally inspiring. It\\'s not, but I am daily building the firm foundation upon which I stand. That has a way of buttressing my security. The same goes for prayer. Though it can feel laborious, I know that I have been with the eternal God, who is also my Father. Lingering in the presence of God enables the truths about God that we know in our heads to travel to the heart.\\n\\n## 3\\\\. Enjoy God\\'s covenant love.\\n\\nA third key to remaining joyful in service is _experiencing God\\'s love for us_. At the end of Romans 8, after two imposing lists of obstacles we face in life, Paul affirms that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ ([Romans 8:35](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.35;esv?t=biblia), [38-39](https://ref.ly/Romans%208.38%E2%80%9339;esv?t=biblia)). This unstoppable love reframes our frustration. God\\'s love overflows into our lives and attacks the bitterness that threatens our contentment ([Romans 5:5](https://ref.ly/Rom%205.5;esv?t=biblia)).\\n\\nPeople basking in God\\'s love are happy people ([1 John 3:1](https://ref.ly/1%20John%203.1;esv?t=biblia)). How could it be otherwise? Experiencing God\\'s love results in joy and provides the key to serving God over the long haul. Jesus told his disciples, \"These things I have spoken to you, that _my joy_ may be in you, and that _your joy_ may be full\" ([John 15:11](https://ref.ly/John%2015.11;esv?t=biblia)). After that, he gave a call to sacrificial service: \"This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you\" ([John 15:12](https://ref.ly/John%2015.12;esv?t=biblia)). First the joy; then the ministry.\\n\\nI once heard David Sitton, founder of To Every Tribe Mission, tell a story from his teenage years when a ninety-year-old missionary spoke at the youth fellowship of his church. The man had been a missionary for 72 years. At the start of his talk, he kept repeating something like, \"I want you to remember this. You can forget everything else I say, but don\\'t forget this.\" As he kept saying this, the young people were getting impatient, wishing that he would go ahead and give them this gem of wisdom. Finally, he said, \"The joy of the Lord is your strength. When the joy goes, the strength goes.\" Having said that, he sat down!\\n\\nThis experience of the Father\\'s love and joy bookmarked Jesus\\'s own ministry. He began by basking in the Father\\'s love and delight embodied in the Spirit ([Matthew 3:16-17](https://ref.ly/Matt%203.16%E2%80%9317;esv?t=biblia)). And that joy proved sufficient to sustain him through the greatest groaning and hardest act of service imaginable. \"For the joy that was set before him \\\\[he\\\\] endured the cross\" ([Hebrews 12:2](https://ref.ly/Heb%2012.2;esv?t=biblia)).\\n\\nAll of our joyful, lasting ministry looks to him ([Hebrews 12:1](https://ref.ly/Heb%2012.1;esv?t=biblia)). Coming to grips with the reality of frustration and knowing how to express our pain prevents disillusionment. The realities of God\\'s sovereignty and love open the door to experiencing joy. So, pursue the joy of the Lord day after day. It alone will sustain us in ministry over the long haul.\\n\\n<|eot_id|>'"

She stands at the door to the kings inner court. She has not been invited into his presence. She hesitates, knowing the fateful step to follow. She may wear the royal robes as a Persian queen, yet she is far more a prized possession than a beloved wife. In fact, the very circumstances of her ascent to the palace were designed to put queens, and all women in the empire, in their place. Her predecessor had refused the kings summons when he desired to show off her beauty at a royal feast. In response, the king deposed his queen and launched an empire-wide search for a new one. Esther, an orphaned Jew under the care of her uncle Mordecai, had won the pageant. She may be a queen, but she is far from his peer -- and not even his only woman. Esther now stands at a crossroads between one likely death or another. The king has been tricked into issuing an irreversible edict against the Jews, not knowing his new queen is Jewish. Her uncle has pled she help her people and warns she too may die if the decree endures. At the same time, death may await if she approaches the king unbidden. Known by all, the royal dictate stipulates, If any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law -- to be put to death. That is, with one exception. Uninvited visitors will be assumed dead on arrival except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live Esther 4 11. Even though Esther questions whether she might not presently be in his good favor As for me, I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days, verse 11, she embraces the risk and puts her hand to the door, knowing, as she has said to her uncle, If I perish, I perish verse 17. She enters. Today, some 2,500 years later, we still celebrate Esthers courage. Faced with such uncertainties and possible death on two sides, she took action that might rescue others, rather than waiting passively for her own fate. But mark this those who claim Christ do not stand in Esthers uninvited, uncertain place when we dare to approach the inner court of heaven. Even though our Kings majesty far outstrips the Persian king of kings over 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia, we approach his throne to make our requests with a stunning confidence. Esther was not wrong to proceed with caution, yet we draw near to a far higher throne and do so with boldness, knowing that, in Christ, the God of heaven already has extended to us his golden scepter. Christian prayer invites a striking mingling of the utmost reverence with the deepest confidence. First, reverence -- and nothing less than reverence -- befits our drawing near to the very throne of heaven, the seat of God Almighty, the all-seeing, all-just, and all-powerful. We need the rebalancing of the Holy Spirit, the whole Christ, and wholesome fellowship. As for that Persian ruler, so-called king of kings, so great were the riches of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his greatness that he could make a show of them for 180 days Esther 1 4. Known to history as Xerxes the Great, his majesty far outshone that of David and Solomon, and even Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus. He was the wealthiest and most powerful man alive, more so than any who had lived to that point in time, surpassing not only his peers but his predecessors. Ponder such a king, and then compare his glory to that of God Almighty. The Majesty who is the great King above all gods Psalm 95 3 is orders of magnitude greater than any Persian ruler. God Almighty deserves far greater reverence upon drawing near. One might dare approach Xerxes, as Esther did, and hope to land his favor. Should we not suspect, then, fear and uncertainty in approaching heavens throne that would dwarf that? Yet in Christ, the true king of kings -- and great high priest -- we are summoned to approach the throne with confidence. While Esther advanced toward the sovereign of Persia with feminine courage, all who are in Christ, men and women, Jew and Gentile, draw near to God Almighty, as exhorts Hebrews, with confidence. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Hebrews 4 16 In Jesus, we come not just to the Seat of Heaven, with its unsurpassed height and greatness, but we come to the throne of grace. It is indeed a throne. The Sovereign over all the world and its history sits in omnipotence. His Majesty far outshines the glories of ancient Persia and Greece and Rome and all human glories, past and present, combined. And still, Hebrews bids us come into his presence. How then might we, weak and inadequate as we are, muster sufficient reverence to approach such a dignitary? We are not left to ourselves, but we have a Helper who is God himself. According to Thomas Boston 1676 to 1732, Gods own Holy Spirit works in us a holy reverence of God, to whom we pray, which is necessary in acceptable prayer. By this view he strikes us with a holy dread and awe of the majesty of God Complete Works, 11 62. And we come to a throne of grace. Can we justly doubt the Fathers favor toward his own Son? The boldness with which we come is not confidence in ourselves, our merit, our dessert, our worth. It is confidence in Jesus, his person, his sonship, his acceptance, his priesthood, his merit, his worth. And here too, we have a Helper. Gods own Spirit, says Boston, works in us this holy confidence This is it that makes prayer an ease to a troubled heart, the Spirit exciting in us holy confidence in God as a Father. If you ask, How will I get this mingling right? Is it not beyond me to have both a reverence worthy of God and a confidence worthy of Christ? Yes, it is beyond us. Which is why the Helper, dwelling in us, is so vital in prayer. He helps us in our weakness Romans 8 26. He works in us reverence, works in us boldness, and keeps working in us their mingling. And with such help, Joseph Hall 1574 to 1656 is so bold as to say, Good prayers never come weeping home. I am sure I shall receive either what I ask or what I should ask. As we pray, day in and day out, we lean on the Spirit to feed both holy reverence and holy confidence in our hearts. And with his help, we seek to keep the whole story of the whole Christ before us his self-emptying in becoming human, his self-humbling in going to the cross, and his power and glory in rising from the dead and ascending to heaven and being seated at Gods right hand. For whole prayers, we need the whole Christ creator God and fellow man. And we need his whole story condescension in the incarnation and cross, and exaltation up from the grave and up to heaven and up to the throne. We need his majesty and meekness, which make us both reverent Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name... and confident... in Jesuss name we pray. Doubtless, our human lives and church lives are complex. In our finitude and sin, we often emphasize one truth to the detriment of another. In both our prayer closets and corporate petitions, we tip toward imbalances -- too casual or too timid -- and need the rebalancing of the Holy Spirit, the whole Christ, and wholesome fellowship. And so along this journey, God manages this mingling in us, this holy blend of awe before his Majesty and audacity in our Messiah. So, what became of Esthers daring entrance? When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she won favor in his sight, and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter. And the king said to her, What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom. Esther 5 2 to 3 So too we come and keep coming -- daily in prayer, weekly in corporate worship. Gods Spirit gives us reverence with confidence, humility with boldness, awe with audacity. In light of Gods might, we approach him with holy fear in light of his mercy, we come with expectant delight. In Christ, we enter not only assured that we already have the Kings favor but knowing that our Fathers kingdom far surpasses all others. And it is our Fathers good pleasure to give it all, with Christ, to his church. Knowing our lowliness and Christs worthiness, we neither grovel nor saunter into the presence of God. And we do not go home flippant or weeping. In Christ, we will receive what we ask or what we should have asked. Thank you, Holy Spirit.\\n\\n<end of article><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n# Good Prayers Go in with Fear\\n\\n\"He helps the soul to approach with confidence, and yet with reverence; with filial fear, and yet with an emboldened faith; with zeal and importunity, and yet with humble submission; with lively hope, and yet with self-denial.\" --David Clarkson (1622-1686)\\n\\nImagine Esther.\\n\\nShe stands at the door to the king\\'s inner court.

Christian prayer invites a striking mingling of the utmost reverence with the deepest confidence. First, reverence -- and nothing less than reverence -- befits our drawing near to the very throne of heaven, the seat of God Almighty, the all-seeing, all-just, and all-powerful. We need the rebalancing of the Holy Spirit, the whole Christ, and wholesome fellowship. As for that Persian ruler, so-called king of kings, so great were the riches of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his greatness that he could make a show of them for 180 days Esther 1 4. Known to history as Xerxes the Great, his majesty far outshone that of David and Solomon, and even Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus. He was the wealthiest and most powerful man alive, more so than any who had lived to that point in time, surpassing not only his peers but his predecessors. Ponder such a king, and then compare his glory to that of God Almighty. The Majesty who is the great King above all gods Psalm 95 3 is orders of magnitude greater than any Persian ruler. God Almighty deserves far greater reverence upon drawing near. One might dare approach Xerxes, as Esther did, and hope to land his favor. Should we not suspect, then, fear and uncertainty in approaching heavens throne that would dwarf that? Yet in Christ, the true king of kings -- and great high priest -- we are summoned to approach the throne with confidence. While Esther advanced toward the sovereign of Persia with feminine courage, all who are in Christ, men and women, Jew and Gentile, draw near to God Almighty, as exhorts Hebrews, with confidence. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Hebrews 4 16 In Jesus, we come not just to the Seat of Heaven, with its unsurpassed height and greatness, but we come to the throne of grace. It is indeed a throne. The Sovereign over all the world and its history sits in omnipotence. His Majesty far outshines the glories of ancient Persia and Greece and Rome and all human glories, past and present, combined. And still, Hebrews bids us come into his presence. How then might we, weak and inadequate as we are, muster sufficient reverence to approach such a dignitary? We are not left to ourselves, but we have a Helper who is God himself. According to Thomas Boston 1676 to 1732, Gods own Holy Spirit works in us a holy reverence of God, to whom we pray, which is necessary in acceptable prayer. By this view he strikes us with a holy dread and awe of the majesty of God Complete Works, 11 62. And we come to a throne of grace. Can we justly doubt the Fathers favor toward his own Son? The boldness with which we come is not confidence in ourselves, our merit, our dessert, our worth. It is confidence in Jesus, his person, his sonship, his acceptance, his priesthood, his merit, his worth. And here too, we have a Helper. Gods own Spirit, says Boston, works in us this holy confidence This is it that makes prayer an ease to a troubled heart, the Spirit exciting in us holy confidence in God as a Father. If you ask, How will I get this mingling right? Is it not beyond me to have both a reverence worthy of God and a confidence worthy of Christ? Yes, it is beyond us. Which is why the Helper, dwelling in us, is so vital in prayer. He helps us in our weakness Romans 8 26. He works in us reverence, works in us boldness, and keeps working in us their mingling. And with such help, Joseph Hall 1574 to 1656 is so bold as to say, Good prayers never come weeping home. I am sure I shall receive either what I ask or what I should ask. As we pray, day in and day out, we lean on the Spirit to feed both holy reverence and holy confidence in our hearts. And with his help, we seek to keep the whole story of the whole Christ before us his self-emptying in becoming human, his self-humbling in going to the cross, and his power and glory in rising from the dead and ascending to heaven and being seated at Gods right hand. For whole prayers, we need the whole Christ creator God and fellow man. And we need his whole story condescension in the incarnation and cross, and exaltation up from the grave and up to heaven and up to the throne. We need his majesty and meekness, which make us both reverent Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name . . . and confident . . . in Jesuss name we pray. Doubtless, our human lives and church lives are complex. In our finitude and sin, we often emphasize one truth to the detriment of another. In both our prayer closets and corporate petitions, we tip toward imbalances -- too casual or too timid -- and need the rebalancing of the Holy Spirit, the whole Christ, and wholesome fellowship. And so along this journey, God manages this mingling in us, this holy blend of awe before his Majesty and audacity in our Messiah. So, what became of Esthers daring entrance? When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she won favor in his sight, and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter. And the king said to her, What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom. Esther 5 2 to 3 So too we come and keep coming -- daily in prayer, weekly in corporate worship. Gods Spirit gives us reverence with confidence, humility with boldness, awe with audacity. In light of Gods might, we approach him with holy fear in light of his mercy, we come with expectant delight. In Christ, we enter not only assured that we already have the Kings favor but knowing that our Fathers kingdom far surpasses all others. And it is our Fathers good pleasure to give it all, with Christ, to his church. Knowing our lowliness and Christs worthiness, we neither grovel nor saunter into the presence of God. And we do not go home flippant or weeping. In Christ, we will receive what we ask or what we should have asked. Thank you, Holy Spirit.\\n\\n<end of article>\"\n",

      "Imagine Esther. She stands at the door to the king's inner court. She has not been invited into his presence. She hesitates, knowing the fateful step to follow. She may wear the royal robes as a Persian queen, yet she is far more a prized possession than a beloved wife. In fact, the very circumstances of her ascent to the palace were designed to put queens, and all women in the empire, in their place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her predecessor had refused the king's summons when he desired to show off her beauty at a royal feast. In response, the king deposed his queen and launched an empire-wide search for a new one. Esther, an orphaned Jew under the care of her uncle Mordecai, had won the pageant. She may be a queen, but she is far from his peer -- and not even his only woman. Esther now stands at a crossroads between one likely death or another. The king has been tricked into issuing an irreversible edict against the Jews, not knowing his new queen is Jewish. Her uncle has pled she help her people and warns she too may die if the decree endures. At the same time, death may await if she approaches the king unbidden. Known by all, the royal dictate stipulates, \"If any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law -- to be put to death.\"\n",

Even though Esther questions whether she might not presently be \"in his good favor\" (\"As for me, I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days,\" verse 11), she embraces the risk and puts her hand to the door, knowing, as she has said to her uncle, \"If I perish, I perish\" (verse 17).
